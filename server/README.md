#Static server

Works with structure like

    mkdir project
    cd project
    
Create file structure like

    build/public/some/static/stuff
    build/public/index.html
    
Get server from asdasdsa 

    git clone asdasd server
    cd server
    npm install
    
At the final your project file structure will be looks like:
    /project/build/public/index.html
    /project/build/public/...
    /project/server/index.js
    /project/server/package.jeon
    /project/server/...
    
Run the server:

    node /project/server/index.js
    
    
Create `.env` with contents like:

    PORT = 8080
